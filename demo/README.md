## Motivation

I wanted to create a color theme to explore the potential of using design tokens to unify design systems across apps. The goal is to eventually tie this theme to the design system of [my website](https://matthewstrom.com) using a design API.

A secondary goal was to create a color theme that minimizes the use of red — I find that looking at colors like blue, green, and yellow make me feel more calm when debugging code :)

## Thanks

A huge thanks goes to [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) for sharing her knoweldge on how to create a VSCode theme. The first versions of the theme were done entirely from her tutorial on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/).

An equally huge thanks to [Danny Banks](https://twitter.com/dbanksDesign). First, for [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary), which makes it a breeze to build VSCode themes from design tokens. Second, the [Nu Disco](https://github.com/dbanksdesign/nu-disco-vscode-theme) theme served as a template for the 1.0 version of this theme — all of the demo files come from that repo.
